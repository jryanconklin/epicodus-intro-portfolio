#### By _**J. Ryan Conklin**_

## Description

_This is a website created using everything learned in the block of Epicodus content. I focused on the functional elements of the assignment, and tried to use CSS and Bootstrap to style the website._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _You can view of copy of the webpage on GitHub pages at [jryanconklin.github.io/portfolio]_


## Known Bugs

_Everything seems to be working at the moment. I ran into issues with the text in the Jumbotron section from Bootstrap. I wasn't able to adjust the text size in that section. This resulted in moving the "About Me" section to the bottom. Which makes a kind of sense, as it placed that information near the Twitter and LinkedIn buttons._
